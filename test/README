To run the full test suite, call <tt>rake</tt>.

The results are non-intuitive, but simple; for each adapter there is a passing
test and a failing test - each passing test should have a green bar at the end,
and each failing test a red one. This is not ideal, but it's a small test suite
and it keeps things simple.

To run a test suite individually, use

  ruby -rubygems test/minitest/test_success.rb
